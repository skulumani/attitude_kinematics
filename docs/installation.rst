Installation Instructions
===========================

The ``kinematics`` package is simple to install. 
It is available from both ``pypi`` as well as ``anaconda``.
Furthermore, the only hard dependency is on the ``numpy`` package which is mostly likely already being used in your project.

To install using ``pip``, you can run::

    pip install kinematics

Instead if you're already using the [Anaconda](www.anaconda.org) distribution, then it is preferrable to use ``conda`` to manage your installed packages.

This is beneficial as ``conda`` provides many additional tools to build independent environments and duplicate these environments between many systems. Here is a good `blog post <https://www.anaconda.com/blog/developer-blog/using-pip-in-a-conda-environment/>`_ describing some of the approaches to utilizing ``pip`` and ``conda``.

To instead install using ``conda`` simply use::
    
    conda install -c skulumani kinematics
